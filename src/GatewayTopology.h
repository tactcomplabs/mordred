/**
 * GatewayTopology — decorates any TopologyAPI implementation (Mesh, Torus2d,
 * Torus3d, FlatButterfly, ...) with cross-domain gateway redirection.
 *
 * Two or more independently-addressed topology domains (e.g. meshes, tori,
 * or a mix) can be joined -- not just pairwise, but in any graph among
 * domains (a triangle of three domains each linked to the other two, a
 * star, a chain, ...) -- if every router in each domain loads
 * GatewayTopology as its "topology" subcomponent, wrapping that domain's
 * real topology in the "inner_topology" slot. Each domain owns a contiguous
 * slice [id_base, id_base+local_range_size) of one shared global id space.
 * A destination outside that slice is "foreign"; the four parallel
 * "remote_*" lists describe, for each OTHER domain directly reachable from
 * here, its own slice [remote_id_bases[i], +remote_range_sizes[i]) and
 * which LOCAL router (remote_gateway_rtr_ids[i]) + port
 * (remote_gateway_ports[i]) is the gateway to it. A foreign destination is
 * matched against these ranges and redirected toward that entry's gateway
 * router; that router alone forwards it out its own extra, dedicated port
 * unchanged (no address translation — the dest field is already globally
 * meaningful).
 *
 * GatewayTopology must be loaded on EVERY router in the domain, not just the
 * gateway routers — MordredRouter calls topology->routePacket() at every
 * hop, including the router where a foreign-destined packet is first
 * injected, so every router needs the full remote-route list to know how to
 * steer such traffic toward whichever gateway serves it (which may be a
 * different router than the one serving some OTHER remote domain). Only a
 * router named as some entry's gateway_rtr_id gets an extra, additive port
 * beyond its inner topology's normal direction set for that entry (never a
 * repurposed cardinal/wraparound port — several inner topologies, e.g.
 * Torus2dTopo and Torus3dTopo, fatal in init() if any of their own
 * router-router ports is left unconnected); a router named as the gateway
 * for more than one remote entry gets one extra port per DISTINCT physical
 * port those entries name, as the trailing contiguous block of port
 * indices -- multiple entries sharing the same gateway_rtr_id AND
 * gateway_port (e.g. two remote domains reachable via the same physical
 * link, see below) are deduplicated to that one port, not double-counted.
 *
 * This also gives multi-hop transit for free, with no address translation:
 * a domain doesn't need a direct link to every domain it needs to reach --
 * it just needs a remote_* entry (or several, aggregated or not) whose
 * range covers that domain's ids and whose gateway_rtr_id/gateway_port
 * point at whichever neighbor is actually directly linked. E.g. in a chain
 * A-B-C, A can have entries for both B's range and C's range that both name
 * A's B-facing gateway; once such a packet crosses into B, B's own
 * (accurate, direct) entry for C forwards it onward -- B needs no awareness
 * that the packet actually originated at A rather than one of its own local
 * endpoints, since routing is purely dest-based at every hop.
 *
 * Broadcast relay assumes every domain is DIRECTLY linked to every other
 * domain it needs to reach (true for a fully-connected graph of domains,
 * e.g. this triangle): a broadcast is relayed out ALL of a router's gateway
 * ports only when it did NOT arrive via one of those ports; a broadcast
 * arriving via a gateway port floods the local domain only and is never
 * re-relayed. In a graph with a cycle among domains (a triangle is exactly
 * such a cycle), re-relaying would double-deliver -- e.g. domain C would
 * see a broadcast both directly from A and relayed via B -- so this only
 * gives every domain a broadcast if it has a direct link to the originator;
 * a domain reachable only via multi-hop through another domain's gateway
 * would not (currently) receive it.
